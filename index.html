        Methylmercury compounds are also on the Proposition 65 list because they can cause cancer.  Exposure to methylmercury compounds may increase cancer risk, and exposure during pregnancy can affect brain development and cause learning and behavior problems for the child.
        Proposition 65 requires businesses to determine if they must provide a warning about exposure to listed chemicals.</p>
